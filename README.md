# MSX Interrupt Mode 1 SDCC Libraries (fR3eL Project)

## Description

This project provides two libraries to work with Z80 Mode 1 interrupts on MSX systems:
- [**interruptM1_ISR**](/ISR) Management of Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) for the Z80 Mode 1 interrupts (MSX-DOS or 48K ROM).
- [**interruptM1_Hooks**](/Hooks) Management of MSX system hooks: TIMI (VBLANK) and KEYI (ROMs or MSX BASIC).

This project is an Open Source library. 
You can add part or all of this code in your application development or include it in other libraries/engines.

Use them for developing MSX applications using Small Device C Compiler [`SDCC`](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/).

This libraries are part of the [MSX fR3eL Project](https://github.com/mvac7/SDCC_MSX_fR3eL).

Enjoy it!
